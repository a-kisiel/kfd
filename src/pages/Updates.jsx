				Since opening on June 23rd things have been going very well.  Patients have been impressed with our Covid-19 
				response, and have overwhelmingly said they felt safe having dentistry and hygiene performed.  We are doing 
				our best, and as an office collectively we feel safe as well!  We have added a $10 onetime fee to help defray the cost 
				of personal protective equipment and laundering needs we have incurred as a result of the epidemic.
				If you called during the quarantine period and have not been called for follow-up emergency 
				treatment, please call our office;  we don't want to leave anyone untreated.  Patients who have been seen must 
				 call our office 48 hours after their visit to let us know whether they have developed any COVID symptoms; this is simply a precautionary 
				 measure that all medical offices are being asked to take. This site will be updated as new information from the state and 
				 federal regulatory agencies change.  Thanks for all your support and cooperation in helping us keep everyone safe during your visit.<br/><br/>

				Dear Patients,<br/><br/>
				Our community has been through a lot over the last few months, and all of us are looking forward to resuming 
				our normal habits and routines.  While many things have changed, one thing has remained the same: our commitment 
				to your safety.
                <br/><br/>
                Infection control has always been a top priority for our practice, and you'll soon see some changes meant to enhance our already stringent measures in that area. We'd like to tell you about some of the procedures we follow in our practice to keep patients and staff safe.
                <br/><br/>
                Our office follows infection control recommendations made by the American Dental Association (ADA), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and OSHA. We follow the activities of these agencies so that we are up-to-date on any new rulings or guidance that may be issued. We do this to make sure that our infection control procedures are current and adhere to each agency’s recommendations.
                <br/><br/>
				In the interest of protecting our patients and staff, we ask that you note the following changes in procedure:
                <br/><br/>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li><div>
					Our office will communicate with you before your appointment to ask some screening questions. Upon arriving at the 
					office, you'll be asked these questions again and your temperature will be taken.
				</div></li>
				<li><div>
					We will have hand sanitizer as you enter the building and throughout the reception area. Hand washing can be done in the 
					bathroom and treatment rooms as well.
				</div></li>
				<li><div>
					We will not have magazines, children’s toys and other such materials available in the waiting area 
					since these items are difficult to disinfect.
				</div></li>
			</ul>

            <div>
				Appointments will be managed to allow for social distancing between patients. That might mean that you’re offered fewer options for scheduling your appointment. We will do our best to space out our scheduled appointments to reduce both the number of patients in the waiting room and each patient's waiting time.
                <br/><br/>
				We are happy to answer any questions you may have about the steps we have taken to keep you, and every patient, safe and comfortable in our practice.
                <br/><br/>
				Sincerely,
                <br/><br/>
				R. Jeffrey Kisiel and Staff
